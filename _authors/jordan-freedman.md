Originally a physicist, during my time at Deliveroo I’ve primarily worked in either the Subscriptions (Plus) or Partner Growth spaces. When not data science-ing, you can normally find me zipping around town on my bike, getting beat up in a boxing ring or working my way through the city’s jazz bars.
