Stephanie is an engineering manager at Deliveroo. Before joining here, she worked at ThoughtWorks as a senior software engineer, and long before that, in the social sector. Outside of work, she is often either thinking about, cooking or eating food â€” which is probably why she joined this definitive food company. She also enjoys traveling and has worked in the US, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and now the UK.
