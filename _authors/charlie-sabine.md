Originally an economist, during my time at Deliveroo I've primarily worked in the payments space. There's never a shortage of fraudsters in the world, so it certainly never gets boring. I also spend a lot of my time working on various data engineering projects, as what good is a data scientist if they don't have any data in the first place?
