I got introduced to data whilst studying astronomy & astrophysics, which I undertook at the ripe age of 29, after many years doing everything from sales to logistics to working in a gym. I loved my studies enough that I planned to go on to post-grad studies.

During the final year of the degree though, I took a part-time evening job with a small food delivery company in central London that had just launched. When the company - "Deliveroo" - started hiring the first full-time analyst and data scientist shortly after, I saw an opportunity and jumped on it, abandoning a future of study in favour of the start-up life. I have never regretted it.

I'm immensely grateful for the slice of luck that came my way back then in 2013, and since then I've worked passionately in a variety of data-focused roles, as both IC and manager, across BI, data science, and now analytics engineering.
