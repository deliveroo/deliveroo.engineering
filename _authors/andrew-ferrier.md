I got introduced to data whilst studying astronomy & astrophysics, which I undertook at the ripe age of 29, after many years doing everything from sales to logistics to working in a gym. I loved my studies enough that I planned to go on to post-grad studies.

However during the final year of the degree, I took a part-time evening job with a small food delivery company in central London that had just launched. When the company - "Deliveroo" - started hiring the first full-time analyst and data scientist shortly after, I opted for the start-up life over academia. I have never regretted it.

Since that slice of serendipity back then in 2013, I've had a front-row seat to the incredible growth of Deliveroo, from a scrappy start-up consisting of a handful of people, to the public company we see today. I've worked passionately to ensure data has been a critical part of that journey, across a variety of teams including BI, data science and now analytics engineering.
