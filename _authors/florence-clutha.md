Having no clear idea of what I wanted to study at university I decided to move from New Zealand to London, and took up a temporary job entering product information onto websites. When the lead analyst went away on honeymoon I was asked to pull some weekly reports and present their findings to senior leadership in his stead, this turned into a permanent data role - eight years later I have worked across numerous brands and business models, with my latest adventure now at Deliveroo.

My life outside of data is filled with attempting to learn how to cook, and doing ballroom dancing with my dance partner.
