I've been at Deliveroo since January 2021 as a software engineer focused in our platform space. You'll likely find me stumbling over obstacles that are way too advanced for me in [obstacle course races](https://nuclear-races.co.uk/) when I'm not building The Next Big Thingâ„¢ (such as a [Discord bot](https://github.com/sansaid/sponty-bot) that plans spontaneous nights out - there's an oxymoron in there somewhere... - or a [Telegram bot](https://github.com/sansaid/debotbot) that facilitates debates).
