I'm a engineering manager here at Deliveroo.

I was born in Spain, where I studied Computer Engineering. Soon after finishing, I moved to Dublin for a couple of years. The plan was to go back to Madrid after that but instead I ended up in London. My family has stopped asking me when I will be back.

I used to be a Python developer but now I'm learning Rails. I don't know what will be next, in the end the language is just a tool!
