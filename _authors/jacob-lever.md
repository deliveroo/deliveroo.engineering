I'm an Engineer on the Care Engineering team. If you've messaged your Rider or had the unfortunate need to chat to a Care Agent about your order then you've used some of the systems I built so far in my time at Deliveroo.

My background is in Maths and Physics but I started making software just before I started University. Since then I've worked on all sorts of projects including Android Apps, low level sensors to measure the inclination of buildings and a booking & marketing system for theatres & arts organisations. To see some examples, see [JacobLever.co.uk](https://jacoblever.co.uk/)
