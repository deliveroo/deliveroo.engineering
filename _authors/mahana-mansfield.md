I always thought I'd be a mathematician, but turned to data science in 2011 shortly after finishing my PhD in 
algebraic topology. Since then I've had great fun doing data science and latterly leading data science teams.
When I'm not doing data science, you can probably find me on the judo mat, in the gym trying to improve my 
Olympic lifting, or reading a never ending stream of health and exercise blogs/papers/books.
