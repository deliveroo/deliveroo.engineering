I'm an incurable geek; always building things (often [in code](https://github.com/jphastings), sometimes in [hackspaces](http://nottinghack.org.uk/), [or both](http://traffic.byjp.me/)) and trying to make time for a bit of [Lindy Hop](https://www.facebook.com/bratpackswingpatrol/).

If you're hacking about with [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org/), pondering the [future of the web](https://medium.com/musings-by-jp/the-web-s-missing-communication-faculty-e2f910b908fa) or thinking of unusual projects with postcards then you should [get in touch!](https://twitter.com/jphastings)
