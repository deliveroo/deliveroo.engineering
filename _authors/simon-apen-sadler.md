I work in the Release Engineering team, part of the Production Platforms Org. At Deliveroo, I focus on improving our internal tooling, Hopper and Geopoiesis (I can't pronounce it either); these are our continuous deployment and infrastructure management tools.

I have a strong interest in Platform and Cloud Infrastructure, Operations, Software Engineering, Automation, DevOps, and Linux Administration.
