I'm a Software Engineer at Deliveroo, working in the Release Engineering team, part of the Production Platforms Org. At Deliveroo I focus on Hopper and Geopoiesis (I can't pronounce it either), our continuous deployment and infrastructure management tools.

I've previously worked across multiple domains, specialising in Platform and Cloud Infrastructure, Operations, DevOps, Software and Linux Administration; with a background in Software Engineering.
