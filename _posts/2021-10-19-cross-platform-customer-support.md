title:  "Roo talks series: Cross-Platform Customer Support with WebViews + GraphQL"
excerpt: >
  The second session in our roo talks series.
---

In this session, we will show some of our recent work on improving our self-serve tools for customers who had a poor order experience. After identifying the issues with our existing self-serve tools, we realized we needed a new, easier to iterate on the platform to power our in-app help experience. We’ll talk about how we used WebViews to build an interface shared by all our platforms across Deliveroo’s tech teams, and a GraphQL powered graph-based system that allows us to concisely represent the customer journeys we want to support in our automated tools.

Give it a watch :)
