title:  "Roo talks series: Why Culture Matters in your Data science team?"
excerpt: >
  The fourth session in our roo talks series.
---

Like most companies, Deliveroo has a set of values.  However, we can probably all think of examples of companies that have values buried somewhere on their intranet pages but no one else really bothers with.  And often the data science team has its own culture, right?  And that might be different from the company culture.  Not at Deliveroo. In this session, I want to take you through some examples of what it is like working in Data Science at Deliveroo.  I’m going to share with you real examples of work done by our brilliant team and I’m going to talk about how we live our values and why they matter to me...and why values should matter to you

Enjoy!
