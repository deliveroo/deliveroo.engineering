  There's a lot to being a production engineer at Deliveroo, and there's no better way to answer this than in a Q&A fashion. So here are some of the questions I get asked and my answer to them. :)

## Who am I?

I am a senior software engineer working at Deliveroo for nearly 1.5 years, focusing in the production engineering space, where we create abstractions for our platform and improve developer effectiveness. Prior to joining Deliveroo, I worked in a mixture of infrastructure and software development roles. My previous experience ranged from working in a telecoms based company which was largely on premises to a consultancy that allowed me to experience multiple cloud environments.

## Why did I join Deliveroo?

I joined Deliveroo because of our engineering excellence. It was actually the chemistry I had with the engineers during my interviews that convinced me to accept the offer. The involvement in the open source community as individuals and the contributions to conferences like AWS re:Invent made me appreciate how much their job was also their hobby - I wanted to be surrounded by people with that mindset.

## What are some of the impactful projects I’ve worked on and contributed to?

Although I only joined in January 2021, I have since been promoted to a senior software engineer which wouldn’t have been possible without the support of our great managers who were able to provide actionable advice. I’ve been involved in projects that ranged from rethinking how we do our database monitoring to reviewing Deliveroo’s architecture at a high level in order to prepare us for future growth.

## What are the challenges I have experienced?

One of the challenges we’re facing right now is analysing some of the decisions that helped Deliveroo get to where it is today. Deliveroo has had amazing engineers make decisions that helped propagate its growth and support an ever growing platform for the last seven years. What we want to do right now is see if those decisions will withstand the next phase of Deliveroo’s growth.

## Where do I see this space going?

We’ve recently hired a new VP, Megan Bigelow, that will be heading up the production engineering space. There are big plans in this space, including the potential for a specialised SRE team. Because we’re in a new phase of Deliveroo’s growth, this space will be focused on discovering some of the pinch-points of our architecture and rethinking our approach in bottlenecks of architecture. This is a very crucial next step for Deliveroo and production engineering will be at the heart of it. As a result, we’re aggressive about our hiring to accommodate these plans, and we’re specifically looking at software engineers to be part of production engineering, since a lot of these problems will need to be solved with custom code.

## Why do I think Deliveroo is the place to be right now and for others' career to thrive?

Deliveroo is a great place to be right now because it’s at the inflection point where we’re making the decisions to accommodate the future of Deliveroo, which could be very different to the Deliveroo we have today. As mentioned before, we’re thinking a lot about how we’re going to scale in the next few years while maintaining our security practices and reliability standards. These are all exciting projects to be a part of.
