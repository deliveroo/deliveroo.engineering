title:  "Roo talks series: Experiments at Deliveroo and Dynamic Average Treatment Effects."
excerpt: >
  ​​The first session of our roo talks series.
---

​​We are really happy to share the recording from our first online talk from the Roo Talks series!
In this session, we first introduce our approach to experiments at Deliveroo, outlining our experimentation philosophy and explaining why we have chosen to build our own experimentation platform. We then discuss a particular issue often faced when testing the impact of new features, services, or products: how to credibly estimate treatment dynamics. This video will provide an insight into the types of statistical challenges we aim to solve as a Data Science org.
Give it a watch :)
