## Hack on!

In June 2022, Deliveroo was one of the main sponsors for the Athena Hackathon! The on-site event (with a virtual build-up), organised every year by ShowCode, aims to encourage, inspire and champion some of the amazing women and non-binary talent in the tech industry.

We spent the hacking weekend speaking to prospective talent, encouraging the hackers, handing out Deliveroo Swag and providing technical mentorship with the support of our Data Science org.

## Take a look at some of the key highlights from June's event

- Over 600 women and non-binary techies (or wannabe techies!) registered
- Over 50 projects submitted at the end of the hackathon
- Over £10,000 in prizes distributed
- Over 30 webinars and workshops

Whilst it was fantastic to see the winning projects and watch the collective hard work come to fruition, overall participation in the event was the most important thing. The dedication and passion for technology and solution building was palpable and we proudly fuelled the good work (which ran into the small hours!) with our  “Dinner with Deliveroo” catering service. A huge well done to the team behind Data Saver Mode, a team of individuals who met and teamed up at the event, and also won the competition!
